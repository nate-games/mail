The GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.0 is a widely used free software license that aims to protect users' freedom to use, modify, and distribute software. Here's a summary of the key aspects of the GPL 3.0:

1. Copyleft: The GPL 3.0 is a copyleft license, which means that if you modify or distribute software licensed under the GPL 3.0, you must also make the source code available under the same license.

2. Distribution: When you distribute GPL 3.0-licensed software to others, you must provide them with the complete corresponding source code, along with any modifications you made.

3. Compatibility: The GPL 3.0 is designed to be compatible with other free software licenses, allowing you to combine GPL-licensed code with code under other compatible licenses. However, there are certain conditions and limitations for compatibility.

4. Patent provision: The GPL 3.0 includes a patent retaliation clause, which means that if someone sues you or any downstream user for patent infringement related to GPL-licensed code, your rights to the software can be terminated.

5. User freedoms: The GPL 3.0 aims to protect users' freedoms by ensuring that they have the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the software. It also promotes the collaborative development and improvement of software.

6. Web applications: The GPL 3.0 addresses the use of software over a network (e.g., web applications) by requiring that if you modify GPL-licensed software and make it available as a service, you must provide the modified source code to the users.
